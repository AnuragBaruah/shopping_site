Think of the high seas and of a buccaneer ship; of a wild seaman with a sea chest full of gold; of Long John Silver; of a buried treasure and of young Jim Hawkins, the boy with the treasure map the key to it all.
<br />
This is the Treasure Island and if you don't think of all this, the pirates will hunt you down and when they find you, for find you they sure will, they will truss you and carry you back to their ship and just before they feed you to the sharks, as you walk the gangplank with a sword digging sharp and sure into your back, they will sing their one last song for you.

“Fifteen men on the dead man's chest
<br />
Yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!”
