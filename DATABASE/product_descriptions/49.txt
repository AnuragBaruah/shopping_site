Product Story:
<br />
Bringing the classic track aesthetics you know best, like wedge midsole and Waffle traction, the Nike Waffle One Crater refreshes the look with transparent details and recycled materials. The TPU heel clip adds energy and combines with a mixture of see-through mesh and lusciously soft fabrics around the tow and eyestay for a modern look. Its springy Crater foam midsole provides a level of support and comfort youve never felt before.
