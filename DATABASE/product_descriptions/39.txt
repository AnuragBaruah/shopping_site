With a passion and longing for the sea, Robinson Crusoe sets on a sea voyage, much against the wishes of his family, only to survive a shipwreck. But he doesn’t give up.
<br />
And after a series of adventurous journeys, eight years later on the same day of September, Crusoe sets sail again. Caught in a sea storm, he is washed ashore on a deserted island after the shipwreck. The sole human survivor, along with a dog and two cats, Crusoe builds his life with whatever is available around and begins to contemplate and consider his situation.
<br />
“Evil: I am cast upon a horrible, desolate island, void of all hope of recovery.
<br />
Good: But I am alive; and not drowned, as all my ship's company were.”
<br />
Will his adventures end here,
<br />
or is there more in store for him?

Establishing realistic fiction as a literary genre, Daniel Defoe’s Robinson Crusoe is regarded as the first English novel. With simple characters and an exceptional interpretation of life, it went on to become a literary masterpiece. The novel has undergone various adaptions and continues to remain an epic.
