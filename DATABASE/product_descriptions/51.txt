Special Technology:
<br />
Flexible Cushioning
<br />
Soft Nike Renew foam with a resilient insole provides cushioning for lasting comfort when you jump, lunge and sprint. The sole flexes with the natural movement of your foot.
<br />
Layers of Stability
<br />
Taking design cues from the Nike SuperRep family of footwear, this version adds an arc at the sole to support side-to-side movement. The grippy rubber tread gives you traction on a range of surfaces.
<br />
Support and Durability
<br />
Updated side supports anchor the laces for secure midfoot containment. Durable mesh that resists high abrasion helps keep your foot cool, while overlays reinforce high-wear areas.
