“I will get at the secret of this document and
<br />
I will neither sleep nor eat until I have found it out.”
<br />
My comment on this was a half-suppressed “Oh!”
<br />
“Nor you either, Axel,” he added.
<br />
As Axel discovers the secret, he decides to keep it to himself. But defeated by his hunger after two days, he reveals it to Liedenbrock. and what follows is a journey to the center of the Earth through Iceland, down a volcanic crater.
<br />
Encountering grave dangers and bizarre phenomena, as they descend down the underground world, will they reach the center of the Earth?
<br />
Adapted into numerous movies and television series, Journey to the Centre of the Earth is a brilliant science fiction adventure. Demonstrating Verne’s power of imagination, this masterpiece is one of his most successful works.
